# Orbital 2021

Proposal for Orbital 2021  
Team Name: FixMyLife  
Proposed Level of Achievement: Artemis  

<h2>Motivation</h2>

Have you ever thought why you aren’t getting your tasks done? Or why you keep missing/forgetting deadlines? And when you tried using a to-do list to fix your life, you inevitably stopped using it.
Many have tried using a planner/to-do lists to organise their lives but most stopped using them after a while. This can be attributed to laziness, troublesomeness of updating their lists constantly, little to no incentive for the extra effort put into maintaining their list. Surely there is a better way to do this?
By taking inspirations from Prof Ben Leong’s coursemology website, we are here to fix that (and your life!) through our gamified to-do list. Who says that doing tasks have to be painful and boring? The gamified system will add a ton of fun and further incentivise/motivate you so that you can finish your task.  

<h2>Aim</h2>
We hope to make a more effective and fun way for users to stay on task through a gamified to-do list app.  

<h2>Features</h2>  
The To-do list provides an interface for users to keep track of their important deadlines as well as to stay up to date with their daily task with the following features:  

* Addition and removal of tasks  
* Adding reminders and deadlines
* Adding custom categories (e.g. work, relationships, health and fitness)  
* Filter and sorting capabilities  

Gamification of the To-do list will provide RPG-like elements to reward users for completing tasks on time with features such as:  

* Character avatar with a power level that progresses with the completion of tasks, which will be reflected in terms of character level and stats  
* Gold and EXP progression system  
* In game shop to purchase items to enhance one’s character avatar’s abilities
* Fighting of Monsters
* Graphic implementation of the game elements to make it more visually appealing  

The app will feature Social elements including:  

* Friends and gifting system  
* Leaderboards
* Party System to incentivise party members to encourage and motivate their other party members
who are falling behind on their tasks  

Backend features:  

* Synchronization of account progress across devices
* Storage of account progress on backend database
